## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Style Guide

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Follow the existing code style

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` A new feature
- `fix:` A bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor:` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` A code change that improves performance
- `test:` Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore:` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Example:

```
feat: add support for custom voice selection

- Add voice ID parameter to audio service
- Update CLI to allow voice selection
- Add tests for voice selection feature
```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage for new code
- Use descriptive test names

### Documentation

- Update the README.md if you change functionality
- Update API documentation for public APIs
- Add JSDoc comments to new functions and classes
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
